# Assessment 1

A project with a qmd file showing basic reproducible report skills

## Instructions

Your task is to write the outline structure of a published paper in your field in a reproducible quarto script. The paper should contain at least one image and one table (ideally small). The report must contain the following:

* [ ] A *project structure* with all needed files 
* [ ] A *setup code chunk* that loads the tidyverse 
* [ ] Before the abstract, use *inline R* to include the version of R you are using, as well as a *bibliographic reference* to the original paper 
* [ ] All *section headers and subheaders* that are present in the paper (i.e., Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Author Notes, References) 
* [ ] Copy the abstract as a *paragraph*, using markdown syntax for any text formatting 
* [ ] Include one relevant *image* from the paper (you can screenshot it from the PDF) with the figure caption  in the appropriate section
* [ ] *Cross reference* the image in the text with automatic figure numbering . You can copy a sentence from the original text that references the figure, or make up a sentence of your own to reference them.
* [ ] Copy sentences with least two *bibliographic citations* from the paper, including the citations via reproducible techniques 
* [ ] Automatically display these citations in the *reference section* using reproducible techniques 
* [ ] Customise the *YAML header*  to: 
    - [ ] a table of contents 
    - [ ] use a non-default theme of your choosing 
    - [ ] hide all code chunks
* [ ] The quarto file should be renderable by the marker 

See [this report](demos/report1_demo.html) for an example.

## Submission

* Covers: chapters 1 and 2
* Worth: 10%
* Do not put your name in your report; use your student ID as the author.
* Please submit a **zip file** containing: 
  1. the .rproj file
  2. your reproducible script, named `report1_studentID.qmd`
  3. any additional files necessary to reproduce your report (e.g., images or bibliography files),
  4. the rendered html report, named `report1_studentID.html`.

## Marking Rubric

You will receive green/amber/red lights for each of 11 elements, and a generic feedback document explaining common issues. Each rubric element is weighted equally. 

* Green: Perfect or nearly perfect
* Amber: Needs some improvement
* Red: Incorrect or absent
