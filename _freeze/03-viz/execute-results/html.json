We'll learn more about how to get our data into this format in @sec-tidy, but to get started we'll use datasets with the right format.\n\nFor example, the table below lists pets owned by members of the psyTeachR team. Each row is an observation of one pet. There are 6 variables for each pet, their `name`, `owner`, `species`, `birthdate`, `weight` (in kg), and `rating` (on a 5-point scale from \"very evil\" to \"very good\").\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n<div class=\"kable-table\">\n\n|name     |owner |species |birthdate  | weight|rating        |\n|:--------|:-----|:-------|:----------|------:|:-------------|\n|Darwin   |Lisa  |ferret  |1998-04-02 |    1.2|a little evil |\n|Oy       |Lisa  |ferret  |NA         |    2.9|very good     |\n|Khaleesi |Emily |cat     |2014-10-01 |    4.5|very good     |\n|Bernie   |Phil  |dog     |2017-06-01 |   32.0|very good     |\n\n</div>\n:::\n:::\n\n\nVariables can be classified as <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/c#continuous' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='Data that can take on any values between other existing values.'>continuous</a> (numbers) or <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/c#categorical' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='Data that can only take certain values, such as types of pet.'>categorical</a> (labels). When you're plotting data, it's important to know what kind of variables you have, which can help you decide what types of plots are most appropriate. Each variable also has a <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/d#data-type' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='The kind of data represented by an object.'>data type</a>, such as <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/n#numeric' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='A data type representing a real decimal number or integer.'>numeric</a> (numbers), <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/c#character' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='A data type representing strings of text.'>character</a> (text), or <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/l#logical' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='A data type representing TRUE or FALSE values.'>logical</a> (TRUE/FALSE values). Some plots can only work on some data types. Additionally, @sec-data-types has more details, as this concept will be relevant repeatedly.\n\n\n![Data types are like the categories when you format cells in Excel.](images/appx/excel-format-cells.png){#fig-excel-format-cells fig-alt=\"The Format Cells interface in Excel showing the list of Category types, including General, Number, Currency, Accounting, Date, and Time.\"}\n\n### Continuous\n\n<a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/c#continuous' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='Data that can take on any values between other existing values.'>Continuous</a> variables are properties you can measure, like weight. You can use continuous variables in mathematical operations, like calculating the sum total of a column of prices or the average number of social media likes per day. They may be rounded to the nearest whole number, but it should make sense to have a measurement halfway between.\n\nContinuous variables always have a <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/n#numeric' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='A data type representing a real decimal number or integer.'>numeric</a> data type. They are either <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/i#integer' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='A data type representing whole numbers.'>integers</a> like `42` or <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/d#double' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='A data type representing a real decimal number'>doubles</a> like `3.14159`. \n\n### Categorical {#sec-categorical}\n\n<a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/c#categorical' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='Data that can only take certain values, such as types of pet.'>Categorical</a> variables are properties you can count, like the species of pet. Categorical variables can be <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/n#nominal' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='Categorical variables that don't have an inherent order, such as types of animal.'>nominal</a>, where the categories don't really have an order, like cats, dogs and ferrets (even though ferrets are obviously best), or <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/o#ordinal' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='Discrete variables that have an inherent order, such as level of education or dislike/like.'>ordinal</a>, where they have a clear order but the distance between the categories isn't something you could exactly equate, like points on a <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/l#likert' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='A rating scale with a small number of discrete points in order'>Likert</a> rating scale. Even if a data table uses numbers like 1-7 to represent ordinal variables, you shouldn't treat them like continuous variables.\n\nCategorical data can have a <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/c#character' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='A data type representing strings of text.'>character</a> data type, also called <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/s#string' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='A piece of text inside of quotes.'>strings</a>. These are made by putting text inside of quotes. That text can be letters, punctuation, or even numbers. For example, `\"January\"` is a character string, but so is `\"1\"` if you put it in quotes. The character data type is best for variables that can have a lot of different values that you can't predict ahead of time.\n\nCategorical data can also be <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/f#factor' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='A data type where a specific set of values are stored with labels; An explanatory variable manipulated by the experimenter'>factors</a>, a specific type of integer that lets you specify the category names and their order. This is useful for making plots display with categories in the order you want (otherwise they default to alphabetical order). The factor data type is best for categories that have a specific number of levels.\n\n::: {.callout-caution}\n## Do not factor numbers\n\nIf you factor numeric data, it gets converted to the integers 1 to the number of unique values, no matter what the values are. Additionally, you can no longer use the values as numbers, such as calculating the mean.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-summary=\"Example\"}\nx <- c(-3, 0, .5)  # numeric vector\nf <- factor(x)     # convert to factor\nx == as.numeric(f) # does not convert back to numeric \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-summary=\"You cannot average a factor\"}\nm <- mean(f)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning in mean.default(f): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nSometimes people represent categorical variables with numbers that correspond to names, like 0 = \"no\" and 1 = \"yes\", but values in between don't have a clear interpretation. If you have control over how the data are recorded, it's better to use the character names for clarity. You'll learn how to recode columns in @sec-wrangle.\n\n### Dates and times\n\nDates and times are a special case of variable. They can act like categorical or continuous variables, and there are special ways to plot them. Dates and times can be hard to work with, but the [<pkg>lubridate</pkg>](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/) package provides functions to help you with this.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# the current date\nlubridate::today()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"2025-09-16\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# the current date and time in the GMT timezone\nlubridate::now(tzone = \"GMT\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"2025-09-16 12:23:09 GMT\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.try}\nComing back to the pets dataset, what type of variable is in each column?

A grammar of graphics (the \"gg\" in \"ggplot\") is a standardised way to describe the components of a graphic. <pkg>ggplot2</pkg> uses a layered grammar of graphics, in which plots are built up in a series of layers. It may be helpful to think about any plot as having multiple elements that sit semi-transparently over each other. A good analogy is old Disney movies where artists would create a background and then add moveable elements on top of the background via transparencies.\n\n@fig-layers displays the evolution of a simple scatterplot using this layered approach. First, the plot space is built (layer 1); the variables are specified (layer 2); the type of visualisation (known as a `geom`) that is desired for these variables is specified (layer 3) - in this case `geom_point()` is called to visualise individual data points; a second geom is added to include a line of best fit (layer 4), the axis labels are edited for readability (layer 5), and finally, a theme is applied to change the overall appearance of the plot (layer 6).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Evolution of a layered plot](images/figures/fig-layers-1.png){#fig-layers fig-alt='A grid of 6 layers buidling up a plot. 1: A blank plot. 2: Adds the x-axis `gini` with ticks 0.3 to 0.6 and the y-axis `welfare_mean` with ticks form 0 to 80. 3: Adds blue scatterplot points. 4: Adds a linear trendline with error shading. 5: Changes the x-axis label to `Gini Index` and the y-axis label to `Mean Welfare (log10)` and the y-axis to a log10 scale with ticks at 3, 10, 30 and 100. 6: Changes the y-axis ticks to 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nImportantly, each layer is independent and independently customisable. For example, the size, colour and position of each component can be adjusted, or one could, for example, remove the first geom (the data points) to only visualise the line of best fit, simply by removing the layer that draws the data points (@fig-remove-layer). The use of layers makes it easy to build up complex plots step-by-step, and to adapt or extend plots from existing code.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Final plot with scatterplot layer removed.](images/figures/fig-remove-layer-1.png){#fig-remove-layer fig-alt='A regression line with Gini Index on the x-axis and Mean Welfare (log10) on the y-axis, showing a negative relationship from 2.5 gini/30 welfare to 6.5 gini/5 welfare.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Loading data {#sec-plots-loading-data}\n\nLet's build up the plot above, layer by layer. First we need to get the data. We'll learn how to load data from different sources in @sec-data, but this time we'll use the same method as we did in @sec-loading-online and load it from an online source. \n\n::: {.try}\nLoad the data by copying the following into a code block in your script, and running the code.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npip <- read_csv(\"https://psyteachr.github.io/reprores-v5/data/pip_gini_welfare_2010.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\nWhen you load the data, `read_csv()` will produce a message that gives you information about the data it has imported and what assumptions it has made. The \"column specification\" tells you what each column is named and what type of data R has categorised each variable as. The abbreviation \"chr\" is for <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/c#character' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='A data type representing strings of text.'>character</a> columns, \"dbl\" is for <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/d#double' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='A data type representing a real decimal number'>double</a> columns, and \"dttm\" is a date/time column.\n\nThis data is from the World Bank's [Poverty and Inequality Platform](https://pip.worldbank.org/poverty-calculator) (accessed on 2025-08-05).\n\nThe first thing you should do when you need to plot data is to get familiar with what all of the rows (observations) and columns (variables) mean. Sometimes this is obvious, and sometimes it requires help from the data provider. Here, each row represents data for one region for one year.\n\n* `region_name` is the name of the world region, like \"South Asia\"\n* `region_code` is the 3-letter abbreviation for region\n* `country_name` is the name of the country \n* `country_code` is the 3-letter country code\n* `reporting_year` is a year 1963 - 2024\n* `reporting_level` is \"national\" for this entire dataset\n* `gini` is a measure of inequality that ranges from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (complete inequality)\n* `welfare_mean` is average welfare per capita (see the [methodology page](https://datanalytics.worldbank.org/PIP-Methodology/) for more info on how this is calculated)\n* `welfare_median` is the amount of welfare per capita that divides the distribution into two equal halves\n\nUnless you specify the column types, data importing functions will just guess the types and usually default to double for columns with numbers and character for columns with letters. \n\n::: {.try}\nUse the function `spec()` to find out all of the column types and edit them if needed.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nspec(pip)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\ncols(\n  region_name = col_character(),\n  region_code = col_character(),\n  country_name = col_character(),\n  country_code = col_character(),\n  reporting_year = col_double(),\n  reporting_level = col_character(),\n  gini = col_double(),\n  welfare_mean = col_double(),\n  welfare_median = col_double()\n)\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nLet's set `region_name` and `region_code` as factors and set the order of the levels. By default, R will order the levels of a factor alphanumerically, however in many cases you will want or need to set your own order.

It's best to check your plot after each step, so that you can figure out where errors are more easily.\n\n::: {.try}\nCreate a blank plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = pip)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/figures/img-build-plot-1.png){fig-alt='A blank plot' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n#### Mapping\n\nThe next <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/a#argument' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='A variable that provides input to a function.'>argument</a> to `ggplot()` is the `mapping`. This tells the plot which columns in the data should be represented by, or \"mapped\" to, different aspects of the plot, such as the x-axis, y-axis, line colour, object fill, or line style. These aspects, or \"aesthetics\", are listed inside the `aes()` function.\n\n::: {.try}\nSet the arguments `x` and `y` to the names of the columns you want to be plotted on those axes.

These are great column labels that fit our rules for naming objects in R (@sec-naming), but are not plot-friendly. \n\nBefore ggplot2 version 4.0.0, you had to always manually change the aesthetic labels with `labs()` or a scale_* function.

Importantly, the layers display in the order you set them up. The code below uses the same geoms to produce a scatterplot with a line of best fit, but orders them differently.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Points first\nggplot(pip,  aes(x = gini, y = welfare_mean)) +\n  geom_point() + # scatterplot\n  geom_smooth(method = lm) # line of best fit\n\n# Line first\nggplot(pip,  aes(x = gini, y = welfare_mean)) +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm) + # line of best fit\n  geom_point() # scatterplot\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Points first versus line first.](images/figures/fig-build-plot-geom2-1.png){#fig-build-plot-geom2 fig-alt='Two nearly identical plots with scatterplot points and a regression line.

Add another code block and copy the plot code, changing the order of geoms. Do they look different?\n:::\n\n#### Plot objects\n\nJust like you can save numbers and data tables to objects, you can also save the output of `ggplot()`. The code below produces the same plots we created above but saves them to objects named `point_first` and `line_first`. If you run just this code, the plots won't display like they have done before.

The  code below produces the plot above by combining the two plots with `+` and then specifying that we want the plots produced on a single row with the `nrow` argument in `plot_layout()`. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add plots together in 1 row\npoint_first + line_first + plot_layout(nrow = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Combining plots with patchwork.](images/figures/fig-build-plot-geom2b-1.png){#fig-build-plot-geom2b fig-alt='The poit0-first and line-first plots displayed in one image side-by-side.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.try}\nCombine your plots using `plot_layout()`.

We'll cover a few of the basic customisations here.\n\n#### Styling geoms\n\nWe should definitely put the line in front of the points, but the points are still a bit dark. If you want to change the overall style of a geom, you can set the arguments `colour`, `alpha`, `shape`, `size` and `linetype` inside the geom function. There are many different values that you can set these to; @sec-plotstyle gives details of these. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(pip,  aes(x = gini, y = welfare_mean)) +\n  geom_point(colour = \"dodgerblue\", \n             alpha = 0.2, # 20% transparency\n             shape = 18,  # solid diamond\n             size = 2) + \n  # setting method & formula avoids an annoying message\n  geom_smooth(method = lm,   # method of linear model (lm)\n              formula = y~x, # formula used to draw line\n              colour = rgb(0, .5, .8),\n              linetype = 3) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Changing geom styles.](images/figures/fig-build-plot-style-1.png){#fig-build-plot-style fig-alt='The same scatter-line plot as above, but the points are transparent blue diamonds instead of solid black circles, and the regression line is dotted and blue instead of solid and blue.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::{.try}\nPlay around with different values above and figure out what the <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/d#default-value' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='A value that a function uses for an argument if it is skipped.'>default values</a> are for `shape` and `size`. \n:::\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## Setting aesthetics overall versus by category\n\nThis method is only for changing the style of *all* the shapes made with that geom. If you want, for example, points to have different colours depending on which region they are from, you set the argument `colour = region` inside the `aes()` function for the mapping. You can customise the colours used with `scale_` functions, which you will learn about below and in @sec-plotstyle.\n:::\n\n#### Format axes\n\nNow we need to make the axes look neater. There are several functions you can use to change the axis labels, but the most powerful ones are the `scale_` functions. You need to use a scale function that matches the data you're plotting on that axis and this is where it becomes particularly important to know what type of data you're working with. Both of the axes here are <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/c#continuous' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='Data that can take on any values between other existing values.'>continuous</a>, so we'll use `scale_x_continuous()` and `scale_y_continuous()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(pip,  aes(x = gini, y = welfare_mean)) +\n  geom_point(colour = \"dodgerblue\", \n             alpha = 0.2) + \n  geom_smooth(method = lm, \n              formula = y~x, \n              colour = rgb(0, .5, .8)) +\n  # customise axis labels and breaks\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = .1))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Formatting plot axes with scale_ functions.](images/figures/fig-build-plot-axes-1.png){#fig-build-plot-axes fig-alt='The same scatter-line plot as above, but the points are transparent blue circles, and the regression line is a solid blue.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `name` argument changes the axis label. The `breaks` argument sets the major units and needs a <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/v#vector' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='A type of data structure that collects values with the same data type, like T/F values, numbers, or strings.'>vector</a> of possible values, which can extend beyond the range of the data (e.g., `gini` values in this set are only between 0.2 and 0.7, but we can specify breaks 0-1 to make the maths easier or anticipate updates to the data).

Usually, if one variable causes the other, you plot the cause on the x-axis and the effect on the y-axis. Here, we want to see if longer wait times cause the calls to be longer. \n\n#### Scatterplot\n\nThe function to create a scatterplot is called `geom_point()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(pip,  aes(x = gini, y = welfare_mean)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scatterplot with geom_point().\"](images/figures/fig-demo-point-1.png){#fig-demo-point fig-alt='A scatterplot with gini (0.2-0.7) on the x-axis and welfare_mean (0-90) on the y-axis.

You can also set `method = loess` to visualise a non-linear relationship.\n\nThe `formula` will default to `y~x` (y predicted by x), but if you suspect a different relationship, you can change this, such as to the equation for a quadratic relationship (`y~x + I(x^2)`).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nloess_plot <- \n  ggplot(pip,  aes(x = gini, y = welfare_mean)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +\n  geom_smooth(method = loess, formula = y~x) +\n  ggtitle(\"Default: method = loess, formula = y~x\")\n\nlm_plot <- \n  ggplot(pip,  aes(x = gini, y = welfare_mean)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm, formula = y~x) +\n  ggtitle(\"Linear: method = lm, formula = y~x\")\n\nlm2_plot <- \n  ggplot(pip,  aes(x = gini, y = welfare_mean)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm, formula = y~x + I(x^2)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Quadratic: method = lm, formula = y~x + I(x^2)\")\n\nloess_plot / lm_plot / lm2_plot \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Different ways to show the relationship between two continuous variables.](images/figures/fig-2-continuous-1.png){#fig-2-continuous fig-alt='Thre versions of a trend line trhough the scatterplot above with gini (0.2-0.7) on the x-axis and welfare_mean (0-90) on the y-axis.

This is represented by the wider shaded area, which means that the true relationship might be anywhere within that area. Add the argument `se = FALSE` to `geom_smooth()` to remove this \"standard error\" shading.\n:::\n\n#### Dates\n\nWe'll need some different data for the next few plots. Run the following code to simulate some data with random dates in the year 2025, random rating on an ordinal scale from 1 to 5, and random scores on a continuous scale from 0-100 that increase over the year and have an inverted-U shaped relationship to rating We'll use simulation a lot in this class to make data so we can change it and see how that affects our code output.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(8675309) # makes the simulation reproducible\n\nn <- 10000 # number of data points to simulate\n\n# make a vector of the first day of the month\nd <- seq(as.POSIXct('2025-01-01'), as.POSIXct('2025-12-31'), by = \"sec\")\n\n# sample n datetimes and randomly assign groups A:E\n# create n scores from a random normal distribution\n# where the mean depends on the month and rating\nsimdat <- tibble(\n  datetime = sample(d, size = n, replace = TRUE),\n  rating = sample(1:5, n, replace = TRUE),\n  mean = 50 + month(datetime) - 6 + abs(rating - 3)*5 - 5,\n  score = rnorm(n, mean, sd = 12)\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThe `datetime` column contains both a date and a time, so use the `date()` function from <pkg>lubridate</pkg> to convert it to just a date.

The `date_labels` argument uses a code for different date formats; you can see the full list of possibilities in the help for `?strptime`. For example, `%b` means \"Abbreviated month name\", whilst if you wanted to use a format like \"2020/01/31\" you could try `\"%Y/%m/%d\"`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(simdat, aes(x = date(datetime), \n                   y = score)) +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm, formula = y~x) +\n  scale_x_date(name = \"\",\n               date_breaks = \"1 month\", \n               date_labels = \"%b\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name = \"Score\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Plotting dates with breaks one month apart.](images/figures/fig-date-month-1.png){#fig-date-month fig-alt='The same plot as above, with each month labelled on the x-axis.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.try}\nIt looks like the score increases across the year, but is this change meaningful?

For example, the plot below shows score by rating, but because there are only 5 levels and a lot of data, it makes it hard to see exactly how many data points there are at each rating level.\n\nIn this section, we'll explore a few options for dealing with this.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(simdat, aes(x = score, y = rating)) + \n  geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Overlapping data makes plots hard to understand.](images/figures/fig-over-plot-1.png){#fig-over-plot fig-alt='A point plot with score (0-100) on the xi-axis and rating (1-5) on the y-axis. Since there are only 5 scores, all of the points are bunched up on the same 5 lines and span nearly the whole x-axis range. This is difficult to read.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Jitter plot\n\nYou can use `geom_jitter()` to move the points around a bit to make them easier to see. You can also set alpha transparency. Here, the x-axis is continuous, so there is no need to jitter the `width`, but the y-axis is ordinal, so the `height` is jittered between -0.2 and +0.2 days away from the true y-value. \n\n::: {.try}\nChange these values to understand what jitter is doing\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(simdat, aes(x = score, y = rating)) + \n  geom_jitter(height = 0.2, width = 0, alpha = 0.1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Jitter plot.](images/figures/fig-jitter-plot-1.png){#fig-jitter-plot fig-alt='The same plot as above, but with the 5 horizontal lines of points spread out from +/- 0.25 around the integer y axis.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Facets\n\nAlternatively, you can use `facet_wrap()` to create a separate plot for each rating. `facet_wrap()` uses the tilde (~) symbol, which you can roughly translate as \"by\", e.g., facet the plot *by* rating. The `labeller` function controls the labels above each plot. `label_both` specifies that we want both the variable name (rating) and the value (e.g., 1) printed on the plot to make it easier to read.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(simdat, aes(x = score)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, \n                 boundary = 0, \n                 fill = \"dodgerblue\", \n                 color = \"black\") +\n  facet_wrap(~rating, \n             ncol = 1, # try changing this to 2 \n             labeller = label_both) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name = \"Score\",\n                     breaks = seq(0, 100, 10))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A histogram with facets.](images/figures/fig-facet-plot-1.png){#fig-facet-plot fig-alt='Five plots, one for each rating level, showing a histogram of the score distribution. The x-axis shows score ranging from 0 to 100 and the y-axis shows count ranging from 0 to 300.

This chapter just gave you a basic overview, and we will go into more detail in @sec-custom-viz). The [further resources](#resources-viz) section at the end of this chapter lists many resources, but the [R Graph Gallery](http://www.r-graph-gallery.com/) is especially useful to get inspiration for the kinds of beautiful plots you can make in R. \n:::\n\n## Exercises\n\nFor the final step in this chapter, we will create a report of data visualisations. You may need to refer back to @sec-reports) to help you complete these exercises and you may also want to take a break before you work through this section. We'd also recommend you <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/r#render' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='To create a file (usually an image or PDF) or widget from source code'>render</a> at every step so that you can see how your output changes.\n\n### New Document\n\n* Create and save a new quarto document named `03-dataviz-exercises.qmd` \n* Give it the title \"Personality Data\". \n* Remove the default template text \n* Add the code below in the set-up code chunk:\n\n````\n```{{r}}\n#| label: setup\n#| include: false\n\nlibrary(tidyverse) \nlibrary(patchwork) \nlibrary(ggthemes)  \n\npersonality <- read_csv(\"https://psyteachr.github.io/reprores/data/personality_scores.csv\")\n```\n````\n\n### Data import\n\nGive human-readable labels to the columns you'll be plotting:\n\n* `Co`: Conscientiousness\n* `Ag`: Agreeableness\n* `Ne`: Neuroticism\n* `Op`: Openness\n* `Ex`: Extroversion\n\n### Summary\n\nCreate a level 2 heading titled \"Overview\". Underneath this heading, write a short summary of what the data set contains (scores on a 5-factor personality questionnaire) and what each of the variables means (you can use the information from the [personality_scores.json](https://psyteachr.github.io/reprores/data/personality_scores.json) codebook).\n\n### Appropriate plots\n\nCreate a visualisation with an appropriate plot style for each question below:\n\n* What does the distribution of scores look like for Agreeableness (`Ag`)?\n* Are Extraversion (`Ex`) and Openness (`Op`) correlated?\n* How many people completed the questionnaire each year? (hint: `year(date)`)\n\n### Combining plots\n\nDuplicate the code for your first plot and create the same for each of the five personality factors. Combine these 5 plots into a single figure.\n\n### Polishing plots\n\nFor each plot:\n\n* Create a level 2 heading in your quarto document and give it an informative title.\n* Write a short summary that interprets the data shown in the plots - it's not enough just to present visualisations, effective reports will also help the reader understand the conclusions they should draw from the plots you've presented.\n* Make sure each plot has a figure caption.\n* Organise your report so that the plots are shown **after** the text summary in each section.\n\n\n### Customising your report\n\n* Look through the different themes available with [<pkg>ggtheme</pkg>](https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/) and choose one to apply to all your plots.\n* Edit the YAML header of your quarto document so that your rendered report does not show any code, messages, or warnings.\n* Set the default figure size to 8 x 5.\n* Customise the figure size for your combined plot so it is readable\n* Add a table of contents\n\n### Inappropriate plots\n\nPick one plot above and make a new version:\n\n* Adjust the visual aesthetics to make it look as bad and as difficult to read as possible.\n* Save the plot as a PNG image\n* Post this plot to the week 3 thread on Teams and explain why it is so bad. Include the code in your post (see @sec-teams for advice on posting code on Teams)\n\n\n## Glossary {#sec-glossary-viz -}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|term                                            |definition                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|:-----------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|[argument](https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/a#argument){target='_blank' class='glossary'}|A variable that provides input to a function.                                                                                                                                        |\n|[categorical](https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/c#categorical){target='_blank' class='glossary'}|Data that can only take certain values, such as types of pet.                                                                                                                        |\n|[categorical](https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/c#categorical){target='_blank' class='glossary'}|Data that can only take certain values, such as types of pet.                                                                                                                        |\n|[character](https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/c#character){target='_blank' class='glossary'}|A data type representing strings of text.                                                                                                                                            |\n|[continuous](https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/c#continuous){target='_blank' class='glossary'}|Data that can take on any values between other existing values.                                                                                                                      |\n|[continuous](https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/c#continuous){target='_blank' class='glossary'}|Data that can take on any values between other existing values.                                                                                                                      |\n|[data-type](https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/d#data-type){target='_blank' class='glossary'}|The kind of data represented by an object.                                                                                                                                           |\n|[default-value](https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/d#default-value){target='_blank' class='glossary'}|A value that a function uses for an argument if it is skipped.                                                                                                                       |\n|[double](https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/d#double){target='_blank' class='glossary'}|A data type representing a real decimal number                                                                                                                                       |\n|[factor](https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/f#factor){target='_blank' class='glossary'}|A data type where a specific set of values are stored with labels;
